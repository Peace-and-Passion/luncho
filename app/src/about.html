      <h6 class="">Luncho is a standardized currency unit designed to help reduce economic inequality between countries.</h6>

      For addressing inequality within a country, use <a href="https://request.land/help" target="_blank">Requestland</a>.
    </section>


    <section>
      <h4> Is Luncho useful for you?</h4>

      Luncho can be highly useful for tasks like currency conversion on pricing pages, and it is especially beneficial for:

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>Digital service providers seeking growth</li>
        <li>Global companies managing wage payments</li>
        <li>Marketers focused on pricing and expansion</li>
        <li>Donors planning contributions</li>
        <li>Journalists advocating for justice</li>
        <li>Economists writing impactful papers</li>
        <li>Teachers shaping the future</li>
      </ul>

      Additionally, you are encouraged to suggest using Luncho to others.

      <p>Note: Luncho is not intended for use within a single country.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Luncho reflects the same value globally</h4>

      <p>
        Luncho is a global value index that remains consistent across different currencies, adjusting for local price levels. With 100 Luncho, you can have an affordable lunch in countries like Japan, Brazil, the USA, and more. It does not include a drink and tip.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, in Japan, 100 Luncho is equal to 1544 Yen (approximately $10.70 USD), while in Brazil it equates to 46.33 Reais ($8.37 USD). In the USA, 100 Luncho is about $17.00. Regardless of the currency, 100 Luncho always represents the same value.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4 class="">The inequality problem</h4>

      <p>
        Luncho aims to address two key contributors to economic inequality. First is the rapid advancement of information technology (IT), which has widened the gap between countries that utilize IT effectively and those that do not. People in developing countries often cannot afford advanced digital services due to their high costs. The second issue is the decreasing share of income going to workers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Solution and examples</h4>

      <p>
        To solve to the IT gap, for example, anyone must have access to the latest digital services
        for commerce, productivity, life, entertainment and so on at affordable prices. We know
        people working on the digital services want to provide their services at appropriate prices
        in countries, but we have not had a good measure to do so. That's the reason why we should
        use the common unit of pricing that has the same value in every country.
      </p>

      <p>Luncho is a universal value index among currencies made for that. A luncho value shows the
        same value in every country taking its price levels into account. Because it doesn't depend on a
        specific currency, it's neutral and fair.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, Salesforce provides great IT services for sales. They provide Professional sales cloud for <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/editions-pricing/sales-cloud" target="_blank">$75 per user per month in the world</a>.</p>
      <p>$75 would be fine for people in the US, but how about people in Pakistan? The price level of Pakistan is one of five of the US. </p>

      <p>
        In such case they can define their pricing in Luncho. You can find that $75 is 941 Luncho on the converter and imagine that the 941 Luncho is for about 10 lunches.</p>

      <p>The converter teaches that 941 Luncho is 3873 Pakistan Rupee. That is for about 10 lunches and $13.7 USD.</p>

      <p>Also in Switzerland 941 Luncho is 61.4 Euro. That is also for about 10 lunches and $65 USD.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In the US</dt>
        <dd>$75 per month, (937 Luncho)</dd>
        <dt>In Pakistan</dt>
        <dd>3872 Rupee per month (937 Luncho, $13.57 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Switzerland</dt>
        <dd>76.27 Swiss Franc per month (937 Luncho, $84.27 USD)</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Another example is the payment of workers' wage. You can define a pay in Luncho, 50,000 Luncho for example, for a job. All workers for the job who live in different countries will experience the same living standard.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In Philippines</dt>
        <dd>Job A:  75194 Philippine Piso per month (50000 Luncho, $1347 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Japan</dt>
        <dd>Job A:  351,599 Yen per month (50000 Luncho, $2517 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In the US</dt>
        <dd>Job A:  $4,003 USD per month, (50000 Luncho)</dd>
      </dl>

      <h4>Luncho[50%]: Partial adoption with factor</h4>

      <p>What if Salesforce thinks that the $13.7 USD would be too cheap for their product in Pakistan, as the price in the US is $75?</p>

      <p>They can use the <i>factor slider</i> in the <a href="countries">countries page</a> to find out prices that are compatible with profit and equality in countries.</p>

      <p>You will see that the graph has a red line and it moves according to the slider value. Luncho[100%] takes the price level into account 100%, while Luncho[0%] does not at all. As its pivot is the United States, the values of countries above the US are decreased, while the values of countries below US are increased.</p>

      <p>Here are reculculated values with Luncho[50%].</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In the US</dt>
        <dd>$75 per month, (937 Luncho)</dd>
        <dt>In Pakistan</dt>
        <dd>12635 Rupee per month (937 Luncho, $44.29 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Switzerland</dt>
        <dd>72.08 Swiss Franc per month (937 Luncho, $79.64 USD)</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Note that the new value $44.38 USD is the middle of the US price $75 and the original value $13.7 without factor in Pakistan, because the factor is 50%.</p>

      <h4>Grow your business with Luncho</h4>
      <p>

        buy your digital service will afford to buy it. Luncho will accelerate the growth of
        your user base as opposed to your revenue beyond the current ones without Luncho.

      <h4>How does it work?</h4>

      <p><b>In the base year of 2019 (pre-Corona), 100 Luncho was equivalent to $12.20 USD. The value of Luncho fluctuates daily in response to inflation rates. As of September 2024, 100 Luncho is valued at $14.95 USD.</b></p>

      <pre>
    In 2019:                           100 Luncho = $12.20
    Inflation rate in 2020: 1.20%  →  100 Luncho = $12.35
    Inflation rate in 2021: 4.70%  →  100 Luncho = $12.93
    Inflation rate in 2022: 8.00%  →  100 Luncho = $13.96
    Inflation rate in 2023: 4.10%  →  100 Luncho = $14.53
    Inflation rate in 2024: 2.90%  →  100 Luncho = $14.95
      </pre>

      <p>
        Country Luncho values are calculated in local currencies using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/faq.htm#q4d">implied Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)</a>. The inflation rate of each country is incorporated into the PPP, reflecting the relative price levels across countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        PPP represents a theoretical exchange rate that reflects the relative cost of goods and services between countries, compared to the US Dollar. We use PPP data from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPEX@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD">IMF World Economic Outlook Database</a>, based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp">International Comparison Program (ICP)</a> led by the World Bank. The ICP tracks very wide range of price levels for thousands of goods like food, medical services, and more every five years. IMF data is updated annually using each country's deflator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, Luncho reflects general price levels in a country actually, <b>not specific lunch prices</b>, and applicable to variety of applications.

      <h4>Limitations</h4>

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li></li>
        <li>
          While you can expect to have an affordable lunch for local residents with 100 Luncho, restaurants catering to tourists tend to be much more expensive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Price levels may vary within a country, with cheaper options in rural areas and higher prices in urban areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes, the Luncho value may seem high compared to typical lunch prices, as seen in Japan, but it accurately reflects the price levels of a variety of goods and services.
