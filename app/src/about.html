      <h4>Luncho reflects the same value globally</h4>

      <p>
        Luncho is a universal value index that remains consistent across different currencies, adjusting for local price levels. With 100 Luncho, you can have an affordable lunch in countries like Japan, Brazil, the USA, and more. It does not include a drink and tip.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, in Japan, 100 Luncho is equal to ${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(100, 'JP') & async } Yen (approximately $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(100, 'JP') & async} USD), while in Brazil it equates to ${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(100, 'BR') & async } Reais ($${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(100, 'BR') & async} USD). In the USA, 100 Luncho is about $${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(100, 'US') & async }. Regardless of the currency, 100 Luncho always represents the same value.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4> Is Luncho useful for you?</h4>

      Luncho can be highly useful for tasks like currency conversion on pricing pages, and it is especially beneficial for:

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>Digital service providers seeking growth</li>
        <li>Global companies managing wage payments</li>
        <li>Marketers focused on pricing and expansion</li>
        <li>Donors planning contributions</li>
        <li>Journalists advocating for justice</li>
        <li>Economists writing impactful papers</li>
        <li>Teachers shaping the future</li>
      </ul>

      Additionally, you are encouraged to suggest using Luncho to others.

      <p>Note: Luncho is not intended for use within a single country.</p>

    <section>
      <h4 class="">The inequality problem</h4>

      <p>
        Luncho aims to address two key contributors to economic inequality. First is the rapid advancement of information technology (IT), which has widened the gap between countries that utilize IT effectively and those that do not. People in developing countries often cannot afford advanced digital services due to their high costs. The second issue is the decreasing share of income going to workers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Solution and examples</h4>

      <p>
        To bridge the IT gap, everyone should have access to the latest digital services—whether for commerce, productivity, daily life, or entertainment—at affordable prices. While those providing digital services aim to price their offerings appropriately across different countries, a reliable measure for doing so has been lacking.
      </p>

      <p>Luncho is a universal value index designed to provide consistent price comparisons across currencies, accounting for local price levels and inflation. Since it isn’t tied to a specific currency, Luncho ensures neutrality and fairness.
      </p>
      <div class="vspace"></div>

      <h5>Salesforce</h5>

      <p>
        Take Salesforce, for example, which offers its Professional Sales Cloud at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/editions-pricing/sales-cloud" target="_blank">$${saleForce_USD} per user per month</a> globally. While $${saleForce_USD} may be reasonable for users in the US, it’s quite different for those in Pakistan, where the price level is about one-fifth of that in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using Luncho, companies can set their pricing more equitably. For instance, $${saleForce_USD} is equivalent to ${saleForce_luncho} Luncho. Since ${saleForce_luncho} Luncho represents the cost of around ${saleForce_lunch} lunches in the US, the converter reveals that the equivalent price in Pakistan would be ${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'PK') & async} Pakistan Rupees, which also covers ${saleForce_lunch} lunches, or about $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'PK') & async} USD. This approach adjusts pricing to reflect local living costs.

        <p>In Switzerland, ${saleForce_luncho} Luncho equals ${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'CH') & async} Euro, which also covers about ${saleForce_lunch} lunches and equates to $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'CH') & async} USD.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In the US</dt>
        <dd>$${saleForce_USD} per month, (${saleForce_luncho} Luncho)</dd>
        <dt>In Pakistan</dt>
        <dd>${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'PK') & async} Rupee per month (${saleForce_luncho} Luncho, $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'PK') & async} USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Switzerland</dt>
        <dd>${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'CH') & async} Swiss Franc per month (${saleForce_luncho} Luncho, $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'CH') & async} USD)</dd>
      </dl>
      <div class="vspace"></div>

      <h5>Workers' wage</h5>

      <p>Another example is paying workers' wages. You can set wages in Luncho, such as ${wage_luncho | numberFormat:'0,000'} Luncho for a job. This ensures that workers in different countries experience the same living standard.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In Philippines</dt>
        <dd>Job A:  ${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(wage_luncho, 'PH') & async} Philippine Piso per month (50000 Luncho, $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(wage_luncho, 'PH') & async} USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Japan</dt>
        <dd>Job A:  ${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(wage_luncho, 'JP') & async} Yen per month (50000 Luncho, $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(wage_luncho, 'JP') & async} USD)</dd>
        <dt>In the US</dt>
        <dd>Job A:  $${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(wage_luncho, 'US') & async} USD per month, (50000 Luncho)</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Luncho[50%]: Partial adoption with adjustment factor</h4>

      <p>What if Salesforce feels that $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'PK') & async} USD is too low for their product in Pakistan, compared to $${saleForce_USD} in the US?</p>

      <p>They can use the <i>factor slider</i> on the <a href="countries">countries page</a> to find prices that balance profitability and fairness across countries.</p>

      <p>You'll notice a red line on the graph that adjusts based on the slider value. Luncho[100%] fully accounts for price levels, while Luncho[0%] ignores them. The United States serves as the pivot point—prices in countries with higher cost levels than the US are reduced, while those with lower cost levels are increased.</p>

      <p>Below are recalculated values using Luncho[50%].</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In the US</dt>
        <dd>$${saleForce_USD} per month, (${saleForce_luncho} Luncho)</dd>
        <dt>In Pakistan</dt>
        <dd>${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'PK', 0.5) & async} Rupee per month (${saleForce_luncho} Luncho, $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'PK', 0.5) & async} USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Switzerland</dt>
        <dd>${luncho.get_currency_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'CH', 0.5) & async} Swiss Franc per month (${saleForce_luncho} Luncho, $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'CH', 0.5) & async} USD)</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Note that the new value $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'PK', 0.5) & async} USD is the middle of the US price $${saleForce_USD} and the original value $${luncho.get_US_dollar_from_luncho(saleForce_luncho, 'PK') & async} without factor in Pakistan, because the factor is 50%.</p>

      <h4>Grow your business with Luncho</h4>
      <p>
        By incorporating Luncho into your pricing, you'll make your digital services more accessible to people in developing countries who previously couldn't afford them. Luncho helps expand your user base by aligning with local purchasing power, promoting growth in your overall customer reach rather than just increasing revenue from existing markets.

    <section>
      <h4>How does it work?</h4>

      <p><b>In the base year of 2019 (pre-Corona), 100 Luncho was defined to be equivalent to $12.20 USD. The value of Luncho fluctuates daily in response to inflation rates. As of September 2024, 100 Luncho is valued at $14.95 USD.</b></p>

      <pre>
    In 2019:                           100 Luncho = $12.20
    Inflation rate in 2020: 1.20%  →  100 Luncho = $12.35
    Inflation rate in 2021: 4.70%  →  100 Luncho = $12.93
    Inflation rate in 2022: 8.00%  →  100 Luncho = $13.96
    Inflation rate in 2023: 4.10%  →  100 Luncho = $14.53
    Inflation rate in 2024: 2.90%  →  100 Luncho = $14.95
    Inflation rate in 2025: 2.70%  →  100 Luncho = $15.39
    ...
      </pre>

      <p>
        Country Luncho values are calculated in local currencies using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/faq.htm#q4d">implied Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)</a>. The inflation rate of each country is incorporated into the PPP, reflecting the relative price levels across countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        PPP represents a theoretical exchange rate that reflects the relative cost of goods and services between countries, compared to the US Dollar. We use PPP data from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPEX@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD">IMF World Economic Outlook Database</a>, based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp">International Comparison Program (ICP)</a> led by the World Bank. The ICP tracks very wide range of price levels for thousands of goods like food, medical services, and more every five years. IMF data is updated periodically using each country's deflator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, Luncho reflects general price levels in a country actually, <b>not specific lunch prices</b>, and applicable to variety of applications.
      </p>

      <h4>Limitations</h4>

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>
          While you can expect to have an affordable lunch for local residents with 100 Luncho, restaurants catering to tourists tend to be much more expensive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Price levels may vary within a country, with cheaper options in rural areas and higher prices in urban areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes, the Luncho value may seem high compared to typical lunch prices, as seen in Japan, but it accurately reflects the price levels of a variety of goods and services.
